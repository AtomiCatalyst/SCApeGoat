    "# Side Channel Analysis Metric API\n",
    "There exists very few comprehensive open-source libraries for side-channel analysis. Libraries that do exist are difficult to use and lack the proper documentation. This Jupyter Notebook outlines some of the most useful metrics when conducting side channel analysis in an easy to understand medium. These metrics do not perform an attack, rather they are used to assess gain insight into the cryptographic system. Many of the metrics in this API require data to be pre-formatted prior to use. However, each metric explains what programmer needs to provide. "

    "## Signal-to-Noise Ratio \n",
    "The signal-to-noise ratio of a signal is defined as the ratio of a signal's data component to the signal's noise component. For side-channel analysis, the SNR of a power trace relates to the ability for an attacker to obtain information from a power trace during an attack. The effectiveness of side channel attack increases for larger SNR values since the signal leakage is more prominent relative to the noise of the signal. Typically recorded power traces need to be partitioned into different sets called labels. \n",

    "## Score and Rank\n",
    "The score and rank metric is a helpful metric to use both during an attack and in the analysis of a system. This metric relies primarily on two steps, first, the full-length cryptographic key is split into multiple segments, called partitions. Typically, these partitions are the size of a byte, but can be either larger or shorter depending on the particular encryption algorithm and user implementation. This means that for partitions that are the size of a byte, there are 256 key possibilities. Next, a scoring function needs to be specified. This function is arbitrary but needs to return a numerical scores such that the higher the score, the more likely a given input key, k, actually produced the traces. Using the scoring function, for each partition, each possible key is ranked from the highest score to the lowest score. The idea of ranking and scoring the key guesses is that as the number of traces increases, the rank will converge to the point that the actual key will remain in the 1st rank, or very close to it for all key partitions.

The order, o, can be any value between 1 and K where K is the number of key guesses. When o is 1, the success rate is only 1 if the correct key was ranked first out of all possible key guesses.
